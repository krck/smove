The app is written in C++ using the QT Framework and QT Creator. Goal is to create a lightweight G-Code based CNC motion control software. Including G-Code parsing and editing functions, a CNC program design GUI and also constant serial communication with the smove-AF printer firmware.

This is all very much “work in progress”
